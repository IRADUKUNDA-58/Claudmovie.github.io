<tr><td>Dating back to the beginning of the movie business, big stars have been the driving force behind people pouring into theaters around the world and handing over money for a ticket. Whether it’s a dead-serious dramatic powerhouse, someone with brilliant comedic timing or a hulking action star, everyone has a favorite actor whom they’d pretty much pay to see in anything.</td><td>My Favourite Romantic Lead Actors and Actresses

This list is in no particular order. To each person I will list some of their best romantic movies (that I have watched).

The actor/actress has to fulfill one or more of the following criteria to make it to the list:

Have a high charmingness level
Be entertaining and witty
Star in enjoyable romantic movies
Star in excellent and memorable romantic movies
Have good acting skills</td><td>Film culture defies easy definition. ... To me, film culture is a process measured by the discourses surrounding the films and the business, the craft and the industry that produces them. These discourses shape values, practices, activities and institutions that, in sum, constitute film culture.</td></tr>
